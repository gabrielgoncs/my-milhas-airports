# Airports Data Filtering Script

- This Python script reads data from an `airports.json` file, filters airports based on the "country" property, and normalizes the "state" property.

- The filtered data is then saved to a new JSON file named `airports-br.json`.

# Motivation

The idea was to write a python script which goes through all these airports and returns the Brazillian ones.

## Usage

1. Place your `airports.json` file in the same directory as the `main.py` script.

2. Run the `main.py` script using Python.

```bash
python main.py
```
